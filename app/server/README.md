# Flask development server
Flask application has been provisioned as a server container in docker-compose.yml using [init-server.sh](/.docker-compose/scripts/init-server.sh) entry point.
The Flask application provides several API endpoints that are utilized by the [React application](/app/client/README.md).
These API endpoints are protected by TheSink Login(AWS Cognito) and Flask-Login, ensuring that
they are accessible only to authenticated users. This setup allows to leverage Python for heavy
mathematical operations and make secure calls to third-party services without exposing secret keys.
